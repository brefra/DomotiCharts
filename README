What is DomotiCharts:
---------------------
DomotiCharts is a wrapper around HighCharts to generate nice charts of 
collected values of DomotiGa devices.
The graphs are based on the logged status changes.


Requirements:
-------------
To be able to view a chart you have to enable logging of the device value to the domotiga database. To do this open the "Edit Device value" form and

- Enter  a "datasource name" at the graphs tab\
- Select the correct value type "gauge" or "counter". Other types are not (yet) supported.
- Enable the "Log status changes to db" option at the option tab.
